# SFX Explorer

## What?
This tool will help you quickly browse through sound effects to pinpoint the ones you need.

### For who?
Anyone who needs to find specific audio files from huge collections. Game developers, video editors,..

### Limitations
Right now it only supports wav file. No mp3, no ogg, no flac...

### What does it do?
It lets you add a folder containing subfolders and audio files.
You can then browse files using keyboard navigation. If you have autoplay checked, it will play each audio file immediately.


Once you've found your perfect SFX, just drag it to Unity/Audacity/whatever.


You can filter files based on their full path.


### Roadmap?
Many things actually :

- search/filter (mvvm + non-hammer + diacritics + several words)
- show file icons (lazy load)
- show file duration (lazy load)
- auto open last folder
- file > open recent folders
- volume control
- show only audio files checkbox
- right click (open folder, open file, copy path, copy file, open with... (add softwares to list))
- copy to... (add folders to list)
- improve audio file compatibility (more wav, mp3, ogg, flac,..)
- save folders to local storage
- panel with sound preview, play button and other data (mono/stereo, file size, etc..)
- short list feature
